# sql-challenge

## Project Tasks:
Design tables for the CSV data, import the data into a SQL database, and analyze the data.

## Repository Setup:
-- Created a new repository named sql-challenge and cloned it to the computer.
-- Inside the repository, created a directory called EmployeeSQL.

## Files:
Downloaded the Module 9 Challenge files: 
1. departments.csv
2. dept_emp.csv
3. dept_manager.csv
4. employees.csv 
5. salaries.csv 
6. titles.csv

## Data Modeling:
Inspected the CSV files and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables.

## Data Engineering:
- Created a table schema for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Ensured primary keys were unique and created composite keys.
- Created tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys and imported the CSV data.

## Data Analysis:
- Listed employee details, including number, name, sex, salary, hire date, and department information.
- Generated various specific lists, such as employees hired in 1986, department managers, and employees in Sales and Development departments.
- Counted the frequency of employee last names in descending order.

Summary:
Successfully completed data modeling, engineering, and analysis tasks to meet project requirements and provided insights into the employee data.
